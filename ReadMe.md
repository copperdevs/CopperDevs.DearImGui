# Coppers DearImGui

> Custom layering around [ImGui.NET](https://github.com/ImGuiNET/ImGui.NET)/[DearImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)

## Info
- This is currently just a wrapper for existing DearImGui bindings, so ImGui.NET is required

## To Do
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Better examples
  - Currently, there is a "simple" raylib example [here](CopperDevs.DearImGui.Example.Raylib) but it could be better
- [ ] Add bindings feature
